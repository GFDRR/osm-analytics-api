1. [Getting Started](#getting-started)

## Getting Started

### OS X

**First, make sure that you have the [API gateway running
locally](https://github.com/control-tower/control-tower).**

We're using Docker which, luckily for you, means that getting the
application running locally should be fairly painless. First, make sure
that you have [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
installed on your machine.

```bash

git clone https://github.com/GFDRR/osm-analytics-api
cd osm-analytics-api
./api.sh develop

```
